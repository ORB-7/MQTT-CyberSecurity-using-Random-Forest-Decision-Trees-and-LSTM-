MQTTEEB-D: IoT Cybersecurity Dataset for AI-Powered Threat Detection in MQTT Networks
This repository presents the MQTTEEB-D dataset, a real-world IoT cybersecurity dataset designed for developing and evaluating AI-powered Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) networks.

The project explores feature engineering techniques and various machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LSTM) to effectively identify different types of network attacks and anomalies within MQTT traffic. The primary focus is on detecting subtle, resource-efficient attacks that might bypass traditional detection methods.
